# Networkingg
This project is a simulated network environment built using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It is designed for practicing networking concepts, configuring devices, and testing cybersecurity setups such as firewalls, IDS/IPS systems, and access control policies.



Routers, switches, and end devices configured in a typical enterprise topology.
- Basic to advanced routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF).
- VLANs and inter-VLAN routing.
- DHCP, DNS, and HTTP server setup.
- ACLs for traffic filtering and network segmentation.

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

1. **Install Cisco Packet Tracer**
   - Download from [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/).
   - Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2. **Open the Project**
   - Launch Packet Tracer.
   - Open `New lab.pkt`.

3. **Explore the Network**
   - Check IP configurations.
   - Use simulation mode to view packet flow.
   - Practice configuring routers/switches via CLI.

4. **Run Tests**
   - Ping between nodes to verify connectivity.
   - Trace route paths.
   - Apply ACLs and test traffic filtering.
